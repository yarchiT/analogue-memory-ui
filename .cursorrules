### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- React
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
- Use TailwindCSS for styling.
- Use semantic commit messages: feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:
- Keep commits focused on single tasks
- Run ESLint before each commit
- Follow the established TypeScript patterns


### Project Overview
Check file .project-overview.md for the project overview.

### Task Management
Check file .cursor-tasks.md for the task management. Start woring on the first uncompleted tasks.
Alaways try to run the project after completing a task to see if it works as expected.
yarn dev.

Then mark the current checkpoint part as completed in the .cursor-tasks.md file.

After completing a task, commit all changes:
